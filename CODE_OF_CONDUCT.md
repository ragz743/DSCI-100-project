DSCI 100 (Feb. 2023) Group Project Contract GOALS What are our team goals for this project? Become more comfortable with coding with R and collaborating using Github Be more familiar in designing predictive models such as regression Meet all criteria to receive a “good” grade (B to A)


What do we want to accomplish? Complete the project to the agreed upon standard (A or B as of right now) Complete the project on time Pace the work so that we are not scrambling to finish near the deadline, and so that no singular person is left with the majority of the work on their hands Everyone should finish the project feeling that they developed the skills outlined in #3


What skills do we want to develop or refine? Better understanding of how the functions work (memorizing) Better ability to spot “messiness” in data and think of appropriate methods to tidy them up Get to know how to use Github repositories and version control better Process of wrangling data (select, pivot_wider, etc…) Creating effective visualizations Become better at troubleshooting coding errors (debugging)


EXPECTATIONS: Communication: Instagram group chat; respond within 1 day; try to have at least a few days of warning if individual is unable to meet deadline we set for ourselves if it affects the rest of the group; frequently update the group on where you are at with your tasks
