    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease was one of the 10 leading causes of deaths worldwide in 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020). These casualties are attributed to numerous potential factors, including but not limited to blood pressure, age, and sex. Our research project aims to answer the following question: what percent accuracy can KNN classification predict the angiographic disease status, mild or severe by investigating a dataset with a sample of 219 people in Cleveland. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are datasets with heart disease information from different regions that can be found at “https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease”. To be more specific, we are using the Cleveland dataset. This dataset includes 219 observations from individual patients (each row represents a single patient) recorded for 14 variables (see definitions of column names 1 in appendix), with no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Background information (Literature Summary): \n",
    "Studies have explored the relationship between certain risk factors and angiographic disease (Benson et al., 2019; Carson et al., 2020; Jousilaht et al., 1999). Correlating factors included: age, sex, diabetes, blood pressure and more (Benson et al.; Jousihlaht et al.). Other attributes, like smoking, are not included in this dataset. Risk factors such as cholesterol levels and chest pain are found to not have meaningful correlation to angiographic disease (Benson et al.; Carson et al.). The above are expected to have good predictive power for angiographic disease diagnosis and will be considered when choosing predictors for the KNN classifier."

    "In order to create a K Nearest Neighbors Classification algorithm for diagnosis of severity of angiographic disease, we first had to choose our predictor variables. We began by reviewing existing scientific literature on factors that relate to heart disease, so as to determine which variables will potentially be useful for the development of a knn-classification model with the maximum accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, the heart disease dataset (Cleveland) was read into an R Jupyter Notebook to be inspected and tidied using the tidyverse package. The original dataset was mostly tidy, there are no missing values so removal of NA was not necessary. However, all variables, including categorical ones, were in dbl and the columns were unnamed, so required data wrangling included assigning the data frame to an object, converting categorical variables to fct and naming columns as defined by descriptions from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the dataset was split into a training and testing set with seed(2023) and 75% of the rows in the training set. Data from the training set was to be used to build the knn-classification model, while data from the testing set represented “new patients” and will be used to test the model’s accuracy since the true diagnosis is known. \n",
    "\n",
    "An exploratory data analysis was performed using the training data, which should be reflective of the overall dataset. The size of the dataset was identified, as well as the means, standard deviations, minimums and maximums of each variable; these characteristics will be considered for scaling and choosing folds for cross validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs were created, plotting each variable against diagnosis. Histograms were used to visualize the distribution of numerical variables, while bar plots were used to visualize the proportions of categorical attributes between mild and severe patients. Potential efficacy of a variable was visually determined by looking for differences in distributions and proportions in attributes between patient groups (patients of mild vs. severe diagnosis)."

    "For the next steps, numerical variables were necessary in order for the knn-classification model to calculate distances between points. Factor variables were converted back to numeric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the 8 initially selected variables, ones that demonstrate different distribution between mild and severe diagnosis, the 4-loop method was performed to definitively determine the predictive power of each variable. This method tests each combination of variables using a model workflow with tuned/optimal k value then evaluates the maximum accuracy of each combination using 10-fold cross validation. We chose 10 folds instead of 5 folds since a higher number of folds will provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance in terms of accuracy with a relatively small training dataset. We visually inspected the resulting accuracies in a table. Variables that decrease the accuracy of the classifier, or do not contribute to a meaningful increase in accuracy, were omitted in the final selection of variables. "

    "Using our final selection of predictors (age, sex, exang, restecg, thal; see definitions in appendix), we created a classification model to tune. With a recipe of our selected predictors that scales and centers all predictors so that they are on a comparable scale, we tested 10 different k values from 1 to 20, then extracted and visualized the resulting accuracy with a line plot. After determining the k value that optimizes accuracy, we created our final classification model specified with k = 15. This algorithm was then tested using observations measured from “new patients” (ie. testing set). The predictions were bound to the testing data frame, accuracy was computed then visualized using a confusion matrix due to the large number of predictors. An additional pair of scatterplots for true vs predicted diagnosis, using age and thal (which had the most variation in values) and color coded by diagnosis, were used to visualize the accuracy of the predicted diagnosis."

    "In this project, we found that the final, most accurate knn-classification model trained through the training dataset from 164 patients, 5 predictors (sex, age, exang, thal, and restecg), and k=15 nearest neighbors, which yielded a prediction accuracy of approximately 75% on the testing dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the outcomes listed above were unexpected. First, an accuracy of 75% is not so subpar that the model is not useful, but it is likely not sufficiently accurate to use reliably in a clinical setting (on average, 25 out of 100 of patients may be misdiagnosed using this model). Secondly, the five predictor variables selected using the for-loop method were not the same variables that that scholarly literature review suggested would contribute to a higher accuracy (history of diabetes (fbs), blood pressure (trestbps)). One potential explanation for these unexpected results is the multi-collinearity of many of the variables. For example, variables such as sex and history of thalassemia (thal) were found to be heavily correlated to each other, which suggests that there is not a substantial increase in additional predictive power of using both predictors (e.g. using both sex and thal). Such variables were found to slightly increase the accuracy of the predictor, so they are presumably still correlated with the diagnosis. Additionally, many of the correlated variable pairs/groups were used together in the final model, so the overall accuracy was decent - but their additional correlation suggests that they are not a truly independent variable and may have contributed to the modest level of predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used lacks variables with great explanatory/predictive ability. Most variables were found to correlate to each other, not correlate to the diagnosis of angiographic disease or found to correlate with diagnosis slightly, which may explain why the accuracy is not exceptionally high. We recommend the collection of more variables, such as a factor variable for smoking history, which according to literature may cause heart disease, to increase the prediction accuracy in further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "This knn-classification model developed is not likely to be of significant use to healthcare providers. A classification model that can be used to diagnose angiographic disease should ideally have an accuracy that is almost that of the actual diagnostic procedure; using the model developed in this project would result in misdiagnosis in about 25% of cases. However the results of this project can be used to inform future attempts to construct such a classifier. Observations for attributes that correlate stronger to diagnosis of angiographic disease severity, or even is the cause behind it, should be measured for datasets that could train a knn-model more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more in depth analysis of the relationship between the variables should take place prior to developing a model, to account for our issue with multi-collinearity. Moreover, beyond the statistical correlation between variables, the causal relationship between the variables in our dataset and a diagnosis could be examined further. Additionally, knn-classification may have simply not been the most effective model, as there are many predictive models in existence that could better account for the kinds of issues that we encountered."
